<font size="5">[Click here to see it live (with code!)](https://replit.com/@strugglebunny/top-tic-tac-toe-js)</font>

## What Is It?

This is a tic tac toe game written in vanilla JavaScript. The user interface was created with HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bulma CSS
- JavaScript

## Learning Objectives

This project is from the JavaScript section of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). The main objective of this activity is to create a game while using as little global code as possible by implementing factory functions and modules.

## Things that could be improved

- Implement a better computer AI with difficulty levels
- Make more responsive
- Refactor some of the code to make it less gnarly and easier to maintain

## Quirks, Oddities, Known Bugs, Etc.

- Works best on a full screen browser on a computer
- Adjusting the viewport to certain sizes will break the layout
- Computer AI is rather stupid (picks squares at random)

## Misc.

User assumes all responsibility, and will not hold the author liable, in the the extremely unlikely occurrence that this app somehow negatively affects your browser, computer hardware, etcetera, etcetera...
